3D Maze - ALX SE Programme Project
This 3D maze implementation is part of the ALX SE Programme project requirements. It leverages raycasting techniques, following LodeV's vector-based method to calculate ray length. By default, the maze includes textured walls, with the option to disable textures during runtime.

Controls:
W: Move forward
S: Move backward
A: Rotate camera left
D: Rotate camera right
Q: Strafe left
E: Strafe right
F: Toggle fullscreen
ESC: Quit
Maps:
Three maps are available for selection, each defined within 2D arrays in text files. These maps are parsed as arguments to the maze executable. In the map representation, 0 denotes open space, while all other integers indicate wall boundaries.

This project is part of the ALX SE Programme.
